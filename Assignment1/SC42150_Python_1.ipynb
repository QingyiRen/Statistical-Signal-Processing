    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to help you get a more practical understanding of some of the concepts of Statistical Signal Processing. Specifically, you will work with stochastic processes and determine their moments, stationarity and ergodicity properties, and also try to detrend the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve those objectives, you will use the Python programming language, and specifically the modules numpy, scipy (for numerical processing) and matplotlib (for plotting). In case you are completely unfamiliar with Python, you should learn the basics before attempting this exercise. You are allowed to use numpy's implementations of common routines, such as mean or cov amongst other, but if you do so make sure you have read the documentation and are sure that they accomplish exactly what is taught in the lecture notes, as sometimes there are small differences in definitions and implementations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you are also going to use the Jupyter Notebook file format, which might require installing some dependencies on your system. You can find instructions on installing Jupyter [here](https://jupyter.org/install).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "The report of this python exercise consists of this Jupyter Notebook file, with your answers added after each question. Answers will consist of code and/or text (markdown) cells. Please use the already indicated cells and format. You will **also** need to deliver a `PDF` version of this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a PDF version of this file, go to the top left, click on `File` then `Export Notebook As` and Choose `PDF`.\n",
    "If this feature is not supported by your system, you can also choose `LaTeX`.\n",
    "Then, you can use your preferred `LaTeX` compiler to create the `PDF`. After generation you PDF report, please double check if all answers/plots are correctly displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, you will also need to send the `.npy` file with the signals used in this exercise. Don't forget to edit your team member's name and student number above. You will submit one Jupyter notebook per team."

You should now have access to a $N\\times K$ array, containing $K$ timeseries of historical price data of various stocks, each of length $N$. Plot the first one and also, in a new figure, plot the first 100 of them together."
